<h3>In 140 Characters or less</h3>

<p>Elastic datastores handle <em>stress</em> losing neither <em>consistency</em> nor <em>availability</em>.</p>

<h3>In detail</h3>

<p>To understand that one need to understand what is <em>Elasticity</em> exactly!</p>

<h4>So, What is <em>elasticity</em> ?</h4>

<p>We have two kinds of elasticity</p>

<h5>General Elasticity</h5>

<blockquote><p>Ability of <em>something</em> to receive a <em>stress</em> without deforming.</p></blockquote>

<p>Think about a rubber band: you can take it with your hands, stretch it
and abandon it : the band will return to its original shape.</p>

<p>Commonly used in physics.</p>

<h5>Point elasticity</h5>

<blockquote><p><em>rate</em> of how much <em>something</em> follows another.</p></blockquote>

<p>Think about two objects, attached to each other by a rubber band :
when one of them moves, the other follows. Not immediately, not in the
same speed (because in the beginning the rubber band will stretch
instead of pull) but follows anyway.</p>

<p>Commonly used in mathematics.</p>

<h4>What is an <em>Elastic</em> ?</h4>

<p><em>Something</em> with a <em>high</em> elasticity.</p>

<h4>So, when is a datastore elastic?</h4>

<p>When it shows, in any form, a high degree of <em>elasticity</em>. Here are some common examples:</p>

<h5>Scaling up and down</h5>

<p>If we consider the <em>General elasticity</em> :</p>

<blockquote><p>The ability of <em>something</em> to receive a <em>stress</em> without deforming.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our <em>something</em> is the datastore, its <em>stress</em> is the force of a high
number of concurrent users (say: your blog got featured highly on
reddit).</p>

<p>The datastore would be elastic if it <em>both</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Scaled up during the stress of that spike in number of visits (say:
used more nodes in the cluster).</li>
<li>Scaled down after the spike back to its original form (say:
returned by himself to its original number of nodes)</li>
</ol>


<p>Not scaling at all would of course not qualify as elastic, but only
scaling up is not enough.</p>

<h5><em>Accepting</em> schema changes</h5>

<p>Again we consider the <em>General elasticity</em> :</p>

<blockquote><p>The ability of <em>something</em> to receive a <em>stress</em> without deforming.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our <em>something</em> : the datastore. Its stress : The data schema changes a lot.</p>

<p>Here our datastore would be elastic if it could handle the changes of
schema on the data and always use its own schema in the end.</p>

<p>This is possible in datastores that are effectively schema-less (like mongo)</p>

<h5><em>Adapting to</em> schema changes</h5>

<p>Let's revisit the same "the data schema changes a lot" problem, but
this time we use <em>point elasticity</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>rate</em> of how much <em>something</em> follows another.</p></blockquote>

<p>The datastore would be elastic if it would be able to take the new
data schema into consideration and (after some time) evolve its own
schema to handle the difference.</p>

<p>This is the approach used by Graph databases to handle the emergence of
relationships that are unknown initially.</p>

<h3>Remember</h3>

<p>Every Elastic has its <em>Yield strength</em> : the point of wich, the
<em>stress</em> is just too much and the <em>elastic</em> loses all <em>elasticity</em>.
Every rubber band has a point where it breaks.</p>

<p>You should seek the <em>Yield strength</em> of your datastore system under
your production architecture.</p>
